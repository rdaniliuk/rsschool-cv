## About Me 
I am 25 years old. At the moment I work in logistics and organize international transportation. I don't have any experience in IT, but I want to change the situation because I believe that in this area if you wish, you can constantly learn something new and develop in the professional sphere while inside the company.

I can attribute sociability, stress istance and a great sense of humor to my advantages
